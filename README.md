# appml-renal-clearance

This is a repository for storing the code for my applied machine learning report. 

The package dependancies are stored in environment.yml and an environment can be set up by running: 

    conda env create -f environment.yml

The data is purposefully missing from this repository. This data can be found with the handed in report, simply copy and paste the Data folder from the .zip into the same folder as the scripts and everything should run.
